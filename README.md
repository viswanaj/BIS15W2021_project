# COVID-19 Healthy Diet Data Analysis
## Bis 15L: Final Project
by Jayashri Viswanathan, Derrick Tran, and Zabrisky Roland (group 13)

In this folder you will find our analysis of the ["COVID-19 Healthy Diet Data Set"](https://www.kaggle.com/mariaren/covid19-healthy-diet-dataset)

We chose to investigate... 1) the relationship between each food category and COVID related deaths through the creation of an app.
                           2) How obesity correlates with COVID deaths and how geographic separation may influence this relationship.
                           3) How undernourishment relates to the death to case ratio.
